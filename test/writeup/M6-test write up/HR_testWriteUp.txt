I wrote BossTest.java

This class currently has two unit tests that check both the stats boost given to the boss monster as well as the drop
that it gives the player after it is defeated

1. testBossDrop():
- In this test I created a player that spawns in the final room. Afterwards I check to see if the boss will drop the
EndGameAttackPotion that the player should receive after it dies. The test will pass only if that is the item the boss
drops.

2. testBossStats():
- This unit test is simple and is started the same way as the previous test. A player is spawned in the final room with
the boss, and then the boss is checked to see if he has the proper health and attack damage he should. The test will
only pass if he has 3500 health and does 350 damage.
